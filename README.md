# PaintME	

## Description
Like to draw? Need a way to share your artistic skills with others? Introducing a new webapp called PaintME. 
PaintME allows users to draw art in house and share them with other users. Users may create PaintME accounts, create
beautiful drawings with their friends and save it to their gallery. These users may also download the images or even 
share it on various social media. You will also be able to follow users and see what drawing they have been making.
We aim to create a complete drawing social media experience.
